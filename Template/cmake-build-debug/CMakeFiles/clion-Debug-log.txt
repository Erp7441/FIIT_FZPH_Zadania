CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "MinGW Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool.
